# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose: 
The Mapping Earthquakes project provides a world view of all earthquakes, highlights major earthquakes and default lines. 

## Method: 
Using an API to to host geographical maps on a local server and pulling geoJSON data from multiple sources, the analyst used html, javascript and css files to create a map that shows earthquake data. The interactive map allows viewers to select layers of data to include on the map including: 
	- tectonic lines
	- color coded circle markers that map earthquakes up to 5 magnitudes. 
	- markers that show major earthquakes that have occurred 
By clicking on the color coded markers, viewers are able to see the magnitude and location of the earthquake. 

## Result: 
The result of the project is a map that includes street, satellite and dark mode views of the map that allow for layers of earthquake data to be added. The map includes a legend and zoom capabilities.
